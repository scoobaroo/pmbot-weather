# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Weather plugin for polymarket bot. TypeScript + Node.js.

## Commands

- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Dev:** `npm run dev` (runs via ts-node)
- **Test all:** `npm test`
- **Test single file:** `npx jest path/to/test.ts`
- **Test single test:** `npx jest -t "test name"`

## Architecture

- `src/` — all source code, entry point is `src/index.ts`
- Compiles to `dist/` via `tsc` (ES2020, CommonJS, strict mode)
- Tests use Jest with `ts-jest` preset, test files go alongside source or in a `__tests__` directory

## Project

polymarket bot that pulls external data to trade profitably on polymarket. Typescript Node.js

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
cargo build              # Build the project
cargo run                # Run the binary
cargo test               # Run all tests
cargo test <test_name>   # Run a single test
cargo clippy             # Lint
cargo fmt                # Format code
cargo fmt -- --check     # Check formatting without modifying
```

Plan Node Default

### 1. Plan mode Default
- Enter Plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete Done without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand-trivial Elegance (Balanced pause)
- For non-fix feels hacky changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If non-fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge the non-trivial change before presenting it
- Document your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

### Task Management
**Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items  
**Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation  
**Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go  
**Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step  
**Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`  
**Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

### Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
